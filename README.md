# FastTree
To run FastTree, you need to run the main.py file.

- Option 1: run the test-small file

- Option 2: run the fasttree-input file

After starting the code, you can type 1 or 2 to run either of the options.

FastTree prints the Newick Format of the output tree. To view the tree you can copy paste this into a tree viewer, like: http://etetoolkit.org/treeview/. 

The algorithm in its current form only works for alligned sequence data without gaps. 
The algorithm is based on the paper from Morgan N. Price et all. (https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/26/7/1641/1128976)
