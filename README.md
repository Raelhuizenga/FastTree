# FastTree
To run FastTree, you need to run the main.py file. To change the input file, you can change the variable 'filename' in the main function. The input file should be in the data folder. 

FastTree prints the Newick Format of the output tree. To view the tree you can copy paste this into a tree viewer, like: http://etetoolkit.org/treeview/.
